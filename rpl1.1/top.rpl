import "test"

-- G is local, so this will fail:
--foo = test.G

-- letter is local, so this will fail:
--foo = test.letter+

-- common is bound in test, but it's an environment so this will fail:
--foo = test.common

-- this works, because digit is exported from test
foo2 = test.digit+

-- digit is not defined locally, so this will fail:
-- foo = digit
