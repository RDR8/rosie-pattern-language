These directories contain sample programs which are little more than proofs of
concept.  When designing librosie, I wanted to ensure that it was callable from
a reasonably broad set of languages.  Those languages had to support libffi, and
further support passing the right data types back and forth (in particular,
strings that can include null bytes, in order to accomodate utf-8 strings.

Note that utf8 strings can contain the null character (code point 0), which is
encoded as a single zero byte.  There exists a "modified utf-8" encoding, which
encodes the null character using the two byte encoding C0 80, but this is not
standard utf-8.
