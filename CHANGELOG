2016-08-09  Jamie Jennings  <jjennings@us.ibm.com>

	* v0.99b

	Fixed an inadvertent change to assignment semantics that
	appeared in v0.99a wherein uses of pattern a were labeled b in the
	output because a was defined as 'a=b'.  The correct behavior is for such
	matches to be labeled a.

	Introduced this CHANGELOG.

	Moved dependencies into ROSIE_HOME/tmp directory.

	Moved docker file examples into ROSIE_HOME/docker directory.
