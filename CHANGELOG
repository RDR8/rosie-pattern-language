	* 1.0.0-alpha-2

	FIXED: Bug triggered by multiple import statements in a single rpl file,
	where the error message did not print and some imports did not load.

	ENHANCED: To accomodate patterns that contain many thousands of
	alternatives, the maximum number of captures handled by the lpeg vm has
	been increased to 1 million.  It can go higher, but should it?

	NEW: "Dark launch" of a new operator called 'and', bound to the
	ampersand, e.g.  A & B & C === >A >B C which means "the input matches A
	and B and C, and the capture will be done using pattern C".

	* 1.0.0-alpha-2

	NEW: Python module (librosie.so, rosie.py)

	NEW: Tests of some basic macros (halt, message, find, findall, and a
	shallow version of the case-insensitive macro called ci

	Note: The halt pattern is implemented, but the abend status of an
	attempted match is not yet available to the user.  I.e. the halt pattern
	is not very useful yet.

	Note: Memory management in librosie has been carefully designed,
	e.g. buffers are reused whenever possible.  BUT testing with a tool like
	valgrind has not been done yet.

	Modified: Backtracking limit for a single pattern is now 1000 (was 400)

	CHANGED: the find macro now looks for a cooked exp and adds boundary
	patterns automatically

	FIXED: bug in REPL (when entering rpl language declaration, e.g. 'rpl 1.0')

	FIXED: issue #63 (typo in README)
