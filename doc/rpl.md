# RPL 1.1 Language Reference

Notes:
1. The RPL language is versioned independently of Rosie itself.
2. See also the [Command Line Interface manual](man/rosie.html) and the interactive [read-eval-print loop (repl)](repl.md) documentation.
3. See also the [Standard Library documentation](standardlib.md).  The RPL
"standard library" is bundled with Rosie and contains many pre-defined patterns.

## Overview

RPL is a compiled, block-structured, lexically scoped, declarative pattern
expression language with a module system.  Names are bound to values of type
_pattern_, _macro_, _function_, and _environment_ (module), although only
patterns are first-class.

### What does this mean?

#### Properties of the language proper

RPL is **compiled** to a form of byte code that is specific to a _matching virtual
machine_ (mvm).  The mvm executes a small instruction set, taking input from a
byte array and produces either a _match_ or an indication that there is no
match.

The compilation process is essential to the design of RPL because it ensures
that many classes of errors can be found at compile time, i.e. in advance of the
deployment of an application that uses Rosie.

**Block structure** means there are lexical units (imaginatively called
"blocks") of code that we can talk about.  In RPL 1.1, there are two kinds of
blocks:
* Files of RPL code
* Grammars

Both kinds of blocks contain bindings, in which names are bound to pattern
expressions.  A file may also contain declarations like `import`.  RPL blocks do
not contain any control flow operators, because there are none.  RPL is a
**declarative expression language** for syntactic patterns, as are regular
expressions and context free grammars.  RPL is based on Parsing Expression
Grammars.

Blocks in RPL have **lexical scope**.  Within a file, all of the names being
bound are visible.  (The order of bindings does not matter.)  In RPL 1.1, file
scope does not, however, allow mutually recursive pattern definitions.

Inside a grammar block, all of the outer (file scope) names are visible, unless
they are shadowed by a local binding (in the grammar) of the same name.
Grammars allow mutually recursive pattern definitions, making them useful for
expressing patterns to match recursively defined syntax like JSON, XML, and
s-expressions.

The first binding in a grammar block is visible in its containing scope, i.e. in
the file scope (because grammars cannot be nested in RPL 1.1).  Any additional
bindings are visible only within the grammar block.

#### Properties of the module system

RPL has a **module system** in which a "file block" of code may define a
package, and another "file block" may use that package.  A file defines an RPL
package when it contains a _package declaration_.

Names in RPL may be _qualified_ or _unqualified_.  Qualified names have a
package prefix and a local name, e.g. `net.ip`.  A qualified name has a binding
when the package prefix is bound to a visible package and the local name is
exported from that package.  Unqualified names are just local names, with no
package prefix.

An **import declaration** instructs the compiler to bind a local name to a
package.  Typically this involves loading the package from a file.  In addition,
a (possibly empty) set of names become visible as qualified names using that
local name as a prefix.  So, the `import net` declaration gives us a local
binding for `net` (which is bound to a module) and makes visible names like
`net.ip`, `net.fqdn`, and others.

The module system is an important design point of RPL because it encourages
principled re-use of patterns through the construction and sharing of modules.
The Rosie "Standard Library" is a lofty name for a set of modules that are part
of the Rosie distribution.


### What is outside the language specification

Rosie implements an RPL compiler which is used to compile RPL pattern
expressions entered on the command line.  For convenience, the Rosie CLI
automatically imports packages referenced in such expressions.

Rosie also implements a read-eval-print loop (REPL) to support interactive
pattern debugging, including a trace facility that shows visually each step of
the matching process.

Neither the CLI nor the REPL are part of the RPL Language.


## Comments and white space

Comments begin with two dashes and end at the next newline character.  White space is not significant.

## Blocks

RPL 1.1 has two kinds of blocks: grammars and files.  Here we describe file blocks.

A file block is defined as follows in [the RPL code for Rosie](../rpl/rosie/rpl_1_1.rpl): 

```
rpl_statements = { {atmos ";" / package_decl / import_decl / language_decl / stmnt / syntax_error}* atmos $}
```

The pattern `atmos` captures whitespace and comments (the "atmosphere" in which
code lives).  A file block can contain empty statements (`;`), package
declarations, import declarations, language declarations, and things called
`stmnt` that should really be called _bindings_.  

| Item                 | Meaning                                                          | Example  |
| ---------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------|----------|
| language declaration | Declares the minimum RPL version required                        | `rpl 1.1` |
| package declaration  | The statements that follow define a package with the given name  | `package net` |
| import declaration   | Load the named package(s) by searching the library path          | `import word, num, net` |
| binding/statement    | Bind a name to a value (e.g. a pattern)                          | `d = [:digit:]` |

Each block element is explained in its own section, below.  No element is
required.  (A block may be empty.)  The compiler enforces the following
constraints on blocks:

* If the language declaration is present, it must be the first non-comment, non-whitespace item in the block.
* If the package declaration is present, it must come before any import declarations.
* Import declarations, if any, must come before the first binding.  There can be many import declarations.
* There can be many bindings.
* A given name may only be assigned once.

In RPL 1.1, a file may contain only one file block.

### Language declaration

This optional element declares that the block requires the given RPL major version, and at least the given minor version.  Major versions are assumed to be incompatible, and minor versions are assumed to be backwards compatible.

Example:
```
rpl 1.1
```

### Package declaration

If the block defines a package, it must contain a package declaration element giving the package name.  The name must follow the same rules as other identifiers in RPL, namely:

* It must start with an alphabetic character
* The remaining characters may be alphanumeric or the underscore

From [the RPL code for Rosie](../rpl/rosie/rpl_1_1.rpl): 

``` 
alias id_char = [[:alnum:]] / [[_]]
alias id = { [[:alpha:]] id_char* }
```

Example:
```
package num
```

The package name is used as a prefix by RPL code that imports a package.  The identifier `net.ipv4` has the prefix `net`, so it is a reference to a package imported under the name `net`.  Packages are typically stored in files, but the name of the file does not have to match the name of the package declared inside that file.  However, it is strongly recommended that a file called `x.rpl` will declare `package x` and not some other package name.


### Import declaration

There can be many import declarations (or none).  An import declaration tells the RPL compiler to load the specified package and to make its exported identifiers available for use.

Rosie uses a package "search path" (a list of file system directories) to find a package.  We will call it the _libpath_.  Its value should be a colon-separated list, e.g. `"~/rosie-pattern-language/rpl:/usr/local/share/rpl"`.  There are several ways to customize the _libpath_:

* When using the Rosie CLI, the _libpath_ can be set on the command line, and this is the value that will be used.
* When calling the Rosie API via librosie, any value you set for _libpath_ will be used.
* If not set using the above methods, then Rosie looks for the value of the environment variable `$ROSIE_LIBPATH`.
* If none of the above, then Rosie will search the `rpl` directory of the Rosie installation.  (This directory is labeled `ROSIE_LIBDIR` in the output of the `rosie config` command.)
* If you set the _libpath_ yourself, you must include the directory of the Rosie standard library if you want Rosie to search there.

The file extension must be `.rpl` for Rosie to find it when searching the directories on _libpath_.

See the documentation for the Rosie CLI, REPL, or API (librosie) for more details.

Variations of the import declaration:

| `import word`                     | Import the `word` package |
| `import word, num, net`           | Import several packages  |
| `import num as n`                 | Import the `num` package, but call it `n` |
| `import word, num as n, net`      | These forms can be combined |
| `import rosie/rpl_1_0`            | A package reference can specify a subdirectory of a directory on the _libpath_ |
| `import a/b/c`                    | Or a chain of subdirectories |
| `import a/b/c as d`               | Import `a/b/c` as `d` instead of the default name, `c` |
| `import "a a/b/c"`                | If the package's path name contains non-identifier characters, it must be quoted |
| `import "a a/b/cde-f" as c`       | If the package file name contains non-identifier characters, it must be quoted and imported `as` a valid identifier |


### Bindings (also called statements)

Statements can be optionally separated with semi-colons (`;`), such as when combining multiple statements on a single line.

|  RPL statement              | Meaning   |
|  -------------------------- | ----------|
|  `identifier = expression`  | Assign a name to a pattern expression |
|  `grammar ... end`          | Define a proper grammar; assignments and aliases appear in place of `...` |


A statement may have modifiers, which are [explained below](#statement-modifiers).  Briefly, they are:

| Modifier | Meaning                                  | Example                          |
|----------|------------------------------------------|----------------------------------|
| `alias`  | Create an alias for a pattern expression | `alias d = [:digit:]`            |
| `local`  | Declares an name to be local to the block where it is defined | `local number = num.signed_number` |
| `local alias`  | The `local` keword must come first | `local alias h = [:xdigit:]` |


#### Simple bindings

A binding like `d = [:digit:]` binds the name `d` to the expression on the right hand side of the `=` sign.  On the right hand side may be any [pattern expression](#pattern-expressions).

* By binding a name, you can use the name in other expressions (in RPL code, on the command line, at the REPL).
* When Rosie matches this named pattern, it captures the input that matched, and tags that input with the pattern name.

When the output is JSON, you can see that the matching text is labeled with the name of the pattern.  The pattern name appears in the "type" field: 

``` 
$ rosie --rpl 'd = [:digit:]' -o json match d
7
{"type":"d","s":1,"e":2,"data":"7"}
$ rosie --rpl 'ds = [:digit:]+' -o json match ds
123
{"type":"ds","s":1,"e":4,"data":"123"}
``` 

For more information on the JSON output format, see [this section](#output-json) below.  You can read more about [RPL expressions](#expressions) below.

The `alias` [statement modifier](#statement-modifiers) will make the name an _alias_ (substitution) for the expression on the right hand side.  That way, the name will not appear in the output.


#### Grammars

In the scope of a file, RPL bindings cannot be mutually recursive.  (The compiler will complain.)  To enable mutual recursion, place the relevant statements inside a _grammar_.  

Mutually recursive patterns can recognize recursive structures like nested lists (e.g. JSON, XML, s-expressions) or things like "strings that have an equal number of a's and b's".  Grammars are defined by putting a set of assignment/alias statements inside a `grammar`...`end` block, e.g.:

```
same = S $
grammar
  alias S = { {"a" B} / {"b" A} / "" }
  alias A = { {"a" S} / {"b" A A} }
  alias B = { {"b" S} / {"a" B B} }
end
``` 
Scope:
* A grammar introduces a new scope.  Bindings from the outer scope are visible, but new bindings in the grammar shadow outer bindings for the same name.  This is the usual lexical scope rule.
* The grammar binds one new name in the outer scope, the name of its first rule.  In the example above, only `S` is visible outside the grammar block.

Notes:
* The `local` keyword is not allowed inside a grammar.  To make the grammar's one visible binding local to the file scope, put `local` before the `grammar` keyword.
* Any binding in a grammar may be an `alias`, including the first bound name.

If the example above were saved to the file `g.rpl`, we could load that file into Rosie and match either `same` or `S`.  The only difference is that `same` ensures that the entire input is matched.  The grammar `S` matches strings that contain the same number of a's as b's (and no other characters).  The second example below does match, because the input `baabb` has 3 b's and only 2 a's.

``` 
$ echo "aabb" | rosie -o json -f g.rpl match same
{"type":"same","s":1,"e":5,"data":"aabb"}
$ echo "baabb" | rosie -o json -f g.rpl match same
$ echo "" | rosie -o json -f g.rpl match same
{"type":"same","s":1,"e":1,"data":""}
``` 

#### Modifiers

**Alias**

Use `alias` to bind a name that is an alias (substitute) for the expression on the right hand side.  Using an alias is equivalent to inserting the expression itself.  In the statement `alias foo = bar+ baz`, the name `foo` is defined.  When it is used in an expression, it is as if `bar+ baz` were used instead.

**Local**

When writing a package of RPL patterns, there are names you want to be visible when someone imports your package.  The `local` modifier hides a definition so that it is not visible.  The scope of a `local` name is the block in which it is declared.  In RPL 1.1, the only place `local` has any meaning (and therefore, the only place it can be used) is in the file scope.


## Expressions

Most of RPL consists of pattern expressions.  Simple expressions compose into
larger expressions.  When a concept in RPL is aligned with regex, it generally
has the same syntax.

Here are some key things to remember:

* To match a literal string, enclose it in double quotes.  Outside of quotes you can use identifiers (names) which are bound to other patterns, aliases, etc.
* Several kinds of character escape sequences can be used in literals and character sets.
* There are 3 grouping mechanisms:
  * `{...}` Curly braces enclose an _untokenized_ expression.
  * `(...)` Parentheses enclose a _tokenized_ expression, in which there is an implicit token boundary between each element of a sequence.
  * `[...]` Square brackets enclose a _bracket_ expression, which is usually used to construct character sets, but can be used more generally as a _disjunction_ of the patterns it contains.
  
### Table of RPL expression types

| Name    | Example                   | Meaning |
| ------- | -------                   | ------- |
| Literal            | `"abcdef"`     | Matches the string `abcdef`.  E.g. `"Hello, world"` matches only the input "Hello, world", with exactly one space after the comma |
| Star (untokenized) | `pat*`         | Zero or more instances of `pat` |
| Star (tokenized)  | `(pat)*`       | Zero or more instances of `pat` with a token boundary between occurrences |
| Plus (untokenized) | `pat+`         | One or more instances of `pat` |
| Plus (tokenized)   | `(pat)+`       | One or more instances of `pat` with a token boundary between occurrences |
| Question           | `pat?`         | Zero or one instance of `pat` |
| Bounded repetition (untokenized) | `pat{n,m}`     | At least n instances, and matching at most m instances of `pat` |
| Bounded repetition (tokenized)   | `(pat){n,m}`   | At least n instances, and matching at most m instances of `pat`, with a token boundary between occurrences |
|                    | `pat{,m}`         | `n` defaults to 0. Analogously, `(pat){,m}` for a tokenized repetition. |
|                    | `pat{n,}`         | `m` defaults to infinity. Analogously, `(pat){n,}` for a tokenized repetition. |
|                    |  `pat{n}`         | Equivalent to `pat{n,n}`.  Analogously, `(pat){n}` for a tokenized repetition. |
| Look ahead         | `>pat`         | Looking at `pat` (predicate: consumes no input)                       |
| Negative look ahead | `!pat`         | Not looking at `pat` (predicate: consumes no input)                      |
|                    | `!>pat`         | Equivalent to `!pat` |
| Look behind        | `<pat`         | Looking backwards at `pat` (predicate: consumes no input)                       |
| Negative look behind | `!<pat`         | Not looking backwards at `pat`.  Equivalent to `<!pat` |
| Ordered choice/alternative | `p / q`        | Ordered choice between `p` and `q` |
| Sequence           | `p q`          | Sequence of `p` followed by `q`     |
| Tokenized sequence | `(...)`         | _Tokenized sequence_, in which Rosie automatically looks for token boundaries between pattern elements |
| Untokenized sequence | `{...}`       | _Untokenized (or "raw") sequence)_ |
|  Named character set | `[:name:]`    | From the POSIX standard:  alpha, xdigit, digit, print, cntrl, lower, space, alnum, upper, punct, graph  |
|                      | `[:^name:]`| Complement. Matches a single character not in the named set. |
| Character range | `[x-y]`         | Matches a single character from the Unicode codepoint of x to the Unicode codepoint of y, inclusive |
|                 | `[^x-y]`        | Complement. Matches a single character not in the given range. |
| Character list  | `[...]`         | Matches any of the characters listed (in place of `...`) |
|                 | `[^...]`        | Complement. Matches a single character not listed in `...`. |
| Union (Disjunction) | `[cs1 cs2 ...]` | Union of one or more character sets `cs1`, `cs2`, etc. (E.g. `[[a-f][0-9]]`) |
|                     | `[^ cs1 cs2 ...]` | Complement. Matches a single character not in the given union. |
| Application         | `fn:pat`     | Apply the macro/function `fn` to `pat`.  See [Macros and Functions](#macros) below. |

### Pre-defined patterns

| Symbol | Name     | Meaning |
| ------ | -------- | ------- | 
| `.`    | dot      | Matches a single Unicode character encoded in UTF-8, or (failing that) a single byte |
| `~`    | boundary | Matches a word boundary, similar to "\\b" in regex.  See below for details. |
| `$`    | dollar   | Matches at the end of the input.  Consumes no input. |
| `^`    | caret    | Matches at the start of the input.  Consumes no input. |
| `ci`   | _macro_  | `ci:pat` matches a case-insensitive version of `pat` |
| `find` | _macro_  | `find:pat` consumes input until `pat` matches; `pat` is a sub-match |
| `findall` | _macro_ | `findall:pat` consumes all input, returning all occurrences of `pat` as sub-matches |
| `keepto`  | _macro_ | `keepto:pat` consumes all input until `pat` matches, returns the data prior to `pat` as a sub-match, in addition to `pat` as a sub-match |
| `message` | _function_      | `message:Str` consumes no input; it inserts a node into the output with type `message` and data `Str`. (See note on strings, below.) |
| `error`   | _function_      |	`error:Str` consumes no input; it inserts a node into the output with type `error` and data `Str`, and then aborts the matching process. (See note on strings, below.) |


### The boundary pattern

The boundary symbol, `~`, is an ordered choice of:
| `[:space:]+`                 | consume all (ASCII) whitespace
| `{ >word_char !<word_char }` | looking at a word character, and back at non-word character
| `>[:punct:] / <[:punct:]`    | looking at punctuation, or back at punctuation
| `{ <[:space:] ![:space:] }`  | looking back at whitespace, but not ahead at whitespace
| `$`                          | looking at end of input
| `^`                          | looking back at start of input
 
**Important note:** `word_char` is the ASCII-only pattern `[[A-Z][a-z][0-9]]`.

While the default boundary pattern is defined as shown, you may redefine it
within an RPL file.  The new definition will be used throughout the RPL file
that contains it.

One reason to customize the boundary is to make it simpler, so that it matches
faster.  Another reason may be to replace the ASCII definitions of whitespace
and word constituents with more rich definitions, e.g. using Unicode predicates.

### A note on strings in RPL

The functions `message` and `error` each take a string argument.  Strings in RPL are marked with a hash symbol (`#`) to distinguish them from pattern literals, and come in two forms:

* `#tag` is the string "tag".  This short syntax is convenient for single words that have the same syntax as RPL identifiers.
* `#"long string"` is the long form syntax.  The "long string" part has the same syntax as RPL pattern literals.  It can contain white space and use escape sequences to denote non-ASCII characters.

### Escape sequences

With any language, there are two things you need to know about escape
sequences.  Which escape sequences _can_ I use, and which _must_ I use?

#### What can I escape in RPL?

In RPL, you can use the any of the following escape sequences when writing
string or character literals:

| RPL syntax | Name | Meaning |
| -----------| -----| --------|
| `\xHH`       | Hex escape | A single byte; where HH is in 00-FF |
| `\uHHHH`     | Unicode escape | The UTF-8 encoding of a Unicode codepoint; HHHH in 0000-FFFF |
| `\UHHHHHHHH` | Long Unicode escape | The UTF-8 encoding of a Unicode codepoint; HHHHHHHH in 00000000-10FFFFFF |
| `\a`, `\b`, `\t`, `\n`, `\f`, `\r` | Subset of [ANSI C escape sequences](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Escape_sequences_in_C) | Codepoints 07 (bell), 08 (backspace), 09 (tab), 0A (newline), 0C (formfeed), 0D (return) |

Rationale: 
1. The RPL hex escape is a variant of the same in ANSI C, except that the RPL
syntax requires exactly two hex digits.  We expect the hex escape to be used
for parsing binary data and for specifying non-characters, such as single bytes
in the range 80-FF.
2. Both Unicode escapes, `\u` and `\U`, are also part of ANSI C, and have been
adopted by other languages as well.  The long form is expected to be needed
rarely, because of the paucity of defined codepoints above FFFF.
3. Several of the ANSI C escape sequences are used much too often to ignore,
particularly tab, newline, and carriage return.  We dropped the vertical tab,
which has fallen into disuse, but kept the bell, backspace, and formfeed
sequences.

#### What escape sequences are mandatory in RPL?

There are only a handful of cases in which an escape sequence _must be used_ in
order to refer to the character itself.

**Rule:** | _Always escape the magic characters_
          | The escape character, backslash, is always magic; to get a literal backslash, write `\\`
		  | In a string, the double quote is magic (signaling the end of the string); to put a double quote in a string, write `\"`
		  | In a character set, the magic characters are `[`, `]`, `^`, and `-`; to put any of these into a character range or list, write `\[`, `\]`, `\^`, and `\-`

Rationale:
1. To reduce cognitive load, we try to reduce the number of rules.  Here, there
is essentially one rule, with variants applying to strings and character sets.
2. Importantly, there are no exceptions to the rule.  The position of a
character in a character set or string is irrelevant to the rule.


### Repetitions are greedy and possessive

Repetitions are expressions like `pat*`, `pat+`, `pat{n,m}`, and all of their
variations.  In RPL, they are _greedy_: They will consume as many repetitions as
possible, always.

Repetitions are also _possessive_: Once they match, they are never re-evaluated.
I.e. later match failures can not cause backtracking (in which an earlier
repetition would be revisited).

### Precedence and association rules

The sequence operator in Rosie is simply adjacency: there is only whitespace between two or more expressions in a sequence.  When adjacency is viewed as an operator, it has equal precedence in RPL with the ordered choice operator.

RPL expressions are left associative.  For example:

* `a b c / d` is equivalent to `(a b c) / d`
* `a b c / d / e f` is equivalent to `(a b c) / d / (e f)`
* `a b c / d e / f g` is equivalent to `(a b c) / (d (e / (f g)))`

The tokenized and untokenized grouping constructs (`()` and `{}`, respectively)
are used in the way that parentheses are usually used in programming: to force
a particular order of operations.  E.g. if you want "a or b, followed by c", write:

* `(a / b) c` for a tokenized sequence that is equivalent to `{{a / b} ~ c}`; or
* `{ {a / b} c }` for an untokenized sequence with no boundary patterns.


## Matches/Captures

Pattern matching technologies like regex are, in their bare form, predicates.
They return a boolean, indicating whether the pattern matched the input.  Of
course, there is a lot of utility to be gained from also returning the part of
the input that matched.  This is why regex introduced the concept of a _capture_.

In regex, you tell the matching engine what to capture by inserting parentheses
into your expression.  In RPL, we took a different approach.

Every named pattern in RPL is (conceptually, at least) captured.  In order to
reduce the size of the match data returned by an RPL matcher (like Rosie), an
implementation may provide directives that indicate which captures may be
omitted from the output.

It is important to understand that the concept of captures is orthogonal to the
semantics of matching.  A goal of RPL is to be able to define patterns based
solely on their ability to match the desired input, and _subsequently_ decide
which captured elements should be present in the output.

Indeed, different users should be able to use the same pattern, with each user
deciding at match time which captured elements they want included in the output.

To obtain this separation of capture semantics from match semantics, we first
imagine that there exists a _complete_ set of captures from which we could, in
theory, select any subset.  In RPL, the complete set of captures includes a
capture for every pattern that has a name.

The rationale for this decision is that the pattern name has the role of a type,
and therefore can be used to tag a capture in a meaningful way.  Another way to
think about it is: if something is important enough that you want to see it
captured in the output, then it deserves a name.

Note: <br>
When a Rosie matching engine is given an anonymous
expression to match against some input, the engine assigns the anonymous
expression the name `*`, which was chosen in part because it is not a valid RPL
identifier, so it cannot be confused with an actual pattern.  This is an
implementation detail, and not part of the RPL language definition.
</small>
</blockquote>

An RPL matching engine (like Rosie) takes an RPL pattern and an input, and
returns some output.  The main piece of output is called (imaginatively) a
_match_.  A second essential piece of output is the amount of unmatched ("left
over") input data.  Recall that RPL is based on Parsing Expression Grammars, and
the convention there is to match as much of the input as possible, and then stop
if the end of the pattern is reached.

(You can always add `$` to the end of a pattern to ensure that a successful
match is one that consumes the entire input.)

Let's assume for now that a _match_ contains a complete set of captures.  There
is a "natural" structure to such a match, and it is a tree.  A node in the tree
is a _match_ record:

<blockquote>
<em>match</em> := { type, s, e, data, subs}
<br>
where
<br>
<blockquote>
<em>type</em> is an RPL pattern name; <br>
<em>s</em> is the start position of the match in the input (1-based); <br>
<em>e</em> is the end position of the match in the input (1-based); <br>
<em>data</em> is the actual text that matched, i.e. the "capture"; <br>
<em>subs</em> is a list of sub-matches (children in the tree);
</blockquote>
</blockquote>






Rosie's match output is structured in a way that mirrors the pattern that was matched.  You can see the structure if you look at the JSON output from Rosie.  (On a terminal, the default is for Rosie to print the matched pieces of input in color.  Use the `-o json` option to get JSON instead.)  There will be one JSON structure for each line in the input, and each structure is called a *match*.  A match contains the name of the pattern that generated it, the starting position in the input of the matched text, the matched text itself, and any *sub-matches*.  Sub-matches have the same structure as matches; i.e. matches have a tree structure.

A match output by Rosie is kind of like a capture in regex.  Except way cooler, because a match has the recursive structure of a parse tree. (In the language of compilers, Rosie's output is a *parse tree*.)

There are a few really important things you need to know about Rosie's matches:

1. Sub-matches are captured only for the identifiers in a pattern.  And only when those identifiers are *not* aliases.  Sub-matches are indexed by the identifier name that generated them.
2. Literal strings in patterns are not returned as sub-matches.  This is a special case of the previous rule.  
3. If you *want* a literal string or some other primitive expression (e.g. `[:digit:]{3}`) to appear as a sub-match, assign it a name.  Here's an example where a literal string is assigned the name `down_message`.  The pattern `alert` contains the identifier `down_message`, and so there will be a sub-match of `alert` called `down_message`:

``` 
down_message = "The system will go down in"
delay = num.int "seconds"
alert = down_message delay
``` 

Remember, aliases are substitutions, like macros in some programming languages.  They do not create a new named capture like ordinary (non-alias) named patterns do.  (Rationale:  Aliases let you give names to patterns, so that you can refer to them by name, without declaring that you want this name to appear as a separate capture/match in Rosie's output.)  The choice between assigning a name to a pattern and creating an alias for the same pattern gives you some control over what appears in the output.

### Anchors

* A Rosie pattern begins matching at the start of the input line, so the `^` (caret) anchor is rarely needed in RPL.  To skip over characters, you have to be explicit in your pattern about what to skip.  See [below](#find_patterns) for more.
* A Rosie pattern will match successfully even if the entire input is not consumed.  To force a match of the complete input line, use the `$` anchor at the end of your pattern to force a match to the end of the input.
* Rosie automatically tokenizes the input in a way similar to the "word boundary" (`\b`) anchor in regex.  There is a Rosie identifier `~` that refers to the boundary definition used by Rosie.  You can use it explictly as needed, e.g. `~date.any~` matches the pattern `date.any` (from [rpl/date.rpl](../rpl/date.rpl)) only when there is a token boundary before and after it.

### Ordered choice

The "alternation" operator in a Rosie pattern is an _ordered choice_.  Instead of using the pipe symbol `|`, which represents equal alternatives in regex, Rosie uses a forward slash `/` to denote an ordered choice between two alternatives.  The pattern `(a / b) c` is read as "a or b, followed by c" and is processed this way:

1. If `a` matches the start of the input, then the choice is satisfied, so go on to match `c`
2. Else if `b` matches the start of the input, then the choice is satisfied, so go on to match `c`
3. Otherwise, the entire pattern fails because `(a / b)` could not be matched

Once a choice is made, Rosie will never backtrack and try another alternative.  Let's make that clear with a different example.  The RPL pattern `a / (a b)` will not match the input "a b" because the pattern will never look for b.  This pattern is processed as follows:

1. If `a` matches the start of the input, then the ordered choice is satisfied, and the overall pattern succeeds
2. Else try the next alternative, `(a b)`.  The sequence `(a b)` will always fail because we arrived here due to the fact that we could not match `a`.  If we cannot match `a`, then we cannot match the sequence `(a b)`.

The order of the alternatives matters in Rosie.  The pattern `(a b) / a` will match input "a b", because this pattern looks for the sequence "a b" first.

When writing RPL patterns, then, we must pay attention to the order of choices in an alternation expression.  Ordered choices are part of Parse Expression Grammars, and while they place constraints on pattern writers, they help guarantee linear-time execution.

### "Tokenized or "cooked" mode

Normally, Rosie tokenizes the input, using whitespace and punctuation to separate the tokens.  Most of the time, this just _does the right thing_, such as when you're trying to match a noun followed by a verb, or a timestamp followed by an ip address.  As a trivial example, consider:

```
a = "a"
b = "b"
``` 

The expression `a b` will match the input "a b" (and "a \t \n  b", etc.) and produce this output:

``` 
$ rosie repl
Rosie> a="a"; b="b"
Rosie> .match a b "a b"
{"data": "a b", 
 "e": 4, 
 "s": 1, 
 "subs": 
   [{"data": "a", 
     "e": 2, 
     "s": 1, 
     "type": "a"}, 
    {"data": "b", 
     "e": 4, 
     "s": 3, 
     "type": "b"}], 
 "type": "*"}
Rosie> .match a b "a     b"
{"data": "a     b", 
 "e": 8, 
 "s": 1, 
 "subs": 
   [{"data": "a", 
     "e": 2, 
     "s": 1, 
     "type": "a"}, 
    {"data": "b", 
     "e": 8, 
     "s": 7, 
     "type": "b"}], 
 "type": "*"}
Rosie> 
``` 

But `a b` will **not** match the input "ab".  Neither will `(a b)`.  An expression like `a b` or `(a b)` should be read as "a, then a token boundary, then b".   

If you wanted to match "ab", then you do not want to match `a` and `b` as separate tokens, but instead as raw characters.  You need the untokenized (or "raw") sequence `{a b}` to match "ab", which will produce this output:

``` 
Rosie> .match {a b} "a b"
No match  [Turn debug on to show the trace output]
Rosie> .match {a b} "ab"
{"data": "ab", 
 "e": 3, 
 "s": 1, 
 "subs": 
   [{"data": "a", 
     "e": 2, 
     "s": 1, 
     "type": "a"}, 
    {"data": "b", 
     "e": 3, 
     "s": 2, 
     "type": "b"}], 
 "type": "*"}
Rosie> 
``` 

**NOTE:** The name of the matched pattern is "*" in the examples above because the pattern `a b` was entered on the command line.  I.e. it does not have a name.

When you quantify a simple expression using `*`, `+`, `?`, or `{n,m}`, Rosie will treat the expression as if it were raw.  So `"foo"+` will match "foofoofoo" and not "foo foo foo".  You can force a tokenized match using a cooked group: `("foo")+` will match "foo foo foo".  Most of the time, quantified expressions are used in character-oriented syntactic patterns, so the default usually _does the right thing_.

But for that occasion when you want to match exactly two ip addresses separated by whitespace, be sure to write `(net.ip){2}`.  The right way to read this expression is to remember that the repetition operator (`{2}` in this example) causes Rosie to look for a sequence.  Since the pattern `(net.ip)` is inside parentheses, the sequence `(net.ip){2}` is equivalent to `(net.ip net.ip)`, which in turn expands into `net.ip ~ net.ip`.

### Greedy quantifiers

There is one way in which regex are particularly concise, which is when you want to match a pattern that _ends_ in a recognizable way.  For example, words from `/usr/share/dict/words` that end in "ear" can be found with the expression `.*ear$` as an argument to `grep`:

```sh
$ grep .*ear$ /usr/share/dict/words | head -5
abear
afear
anear
appear
arear
```

<a name="find_patterns"></a>
In RPL patterns, quantifiers like `*` are greedy and will eat up as much input as possible.  The pattern `.*ear` will never match anything in RPL, because the `.*` will consume all the input, leaving nothing to match "ear".  You have to tell Rosie when to _stop_ consuming input.  (This is one reason that RPL grammars are efficient.)

To write an RPL pattern that consumes characters (`.` consumes 1 character) until the string "ear" is found, and then match "ear", you could write:

```
{ !"ear" . }* "ear"
```

The part of the pattern inside the braces reads as "while not looking at _ear_, match any character".  The star `*` says to repeat this zero or more times.

Because this is a frequent idiom, Rosie provides a macro called `find1` that searches for a pattern, and then consumes it.  For example, let's look for words that end in "ear":

``` 
$ rosie match -o line '{ {!"ear" .}* "ear" $}' /usr/share/dict/words | head -5
abear
afear
anear
appear
arear
$ rosie match -o line '{ find1:"ear" $}' /usr/share/dict/words | head -5
abear
afear
anear
appear
arear
$ 
```

Another common use of Unix grep is to find all occurrences of a pattern.  (The `grep -o` option will print all of the matches.)  The Rosie macro `find` provides a shorthand for grep's behavior.

### Matching the entire input line with nothing left over

Rosie is happy to match the first part of a line and ignore the rest.  Often, this is a good thing, but not always.  If you want to be sure that the entire input matches your pattern with no input left over, use the "end of input" pattern, `$`.

### Matching starts at the first character of the line

The Rosie Pattern Engine begins matching with the first character of the input.  This is why the `find1` macro is so useful.  Also, remember that the token boundary `~` can be used to skip over whitespace, e.g.

``` 
$ rosie repl
Rosie> import num
Rosie> .debug off
Debug is off
Rosie> .match num.int "    321"
No match  [Turn debug on to show the trace output]
Rosie> .match ~ num.int "    321"
{"data": "    321",

     "e": 8,
