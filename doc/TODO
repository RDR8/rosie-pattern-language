Major work items:

* Consolidate the Rosie API

* Use syntax transformation (on ASTs) instead of current code for:
    - quantified expressions
    - tokenization ("cooked" expressions)
    - repetition syntax with one bound, e.g. {5} (meaning {5,5})

* Enhance syntax error reporting AFTER the syntax transformation work is done.

* Implement post-match instructions, based on prototype work

* Enforce package namespaces, with import/export declarations
